- [2016] del.icio.us was gone since about 2009, and redirected to delicious.com.
  At the moment there is another login page back at del.icio.us. Not sure what
  they're up to now.

  Merged with automatic export of old Google Code repo. Maybe look if there is
  a new API up. But for now need access to XML parsing routines.

  See ReadMe-old.rst

- old code at http:code.google.com/p/pydelicious/
